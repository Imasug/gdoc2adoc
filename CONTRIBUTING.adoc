= Contributing

I would love contributions in form of bug reports or even better pull
request fixing bugs or missing features!

The best way to do bug reports are that you replicate the issue in a Google
Document, make it publically readable (if I need to edit, I can copy
it) and put a link to said document in your bug reports and/or pull
requests.

If you are adding or requesting a new feature please do not hesitate
to simply copy the
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19VD9FCTj6tHeWxdhkmctA1r9Ko3surX3Ee8wp_iwlo4/edit?usp=sharing[test
document] and provide a link to your new document (remember to share
it) with the new/missing feture illustrated in a new section.

For fun I've also enabled comments on the test document so you can actually provide
suggestions directly - if you do, please put a link back to the relevant issue
or pull-request in this git repo.

Thank you!
